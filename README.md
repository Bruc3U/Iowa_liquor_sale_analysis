# I/Defining the goal:

The recent events of 2020, made drastic changes to our society. Many businesses and jobs went remote. <br>
Individuals lost their habits of going out for a while and formed new habits.<br>
The fallout of COVID made many people travel less, and go out less frequently. Many habits were changed. 

Since alcohol is an important part of Western culture, the changes brought by such events would indeed reflect this aspect.<br>
Our focus will be to determine how COVID-19 changed individual habits of alcohol consumption.<br>
In order to do so, we will look at the sales, best-selling products, and time of purchase.
